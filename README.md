# Hunter-s-Journal
Journal for the Hunter's of Yharnem
It takes heavy inspiration off the game called Bloodborne. You play as a hunter in a Lovecraftian world and this program serves as the hunter's "journal". You can document your journey throughout the game the journal. Making entries of what your say/experience in the city of Yharnam( City where game takes place ). Not only can you document your journey but you can upload your character's build( the build is your character's attributes, like their strength, skill, health, stamina, etc.) to test certain weapons and build without impacting your actual build in the game. You enter all the attributes in their corresponding places and we will save it an assist you to improve your build. 

An achievement tab and a mobile port for android is still in works. And the overall UI design is still in planning and development.
